-------------Reading Files Python--------------

#Download Data
import urllib.request

filename = 'Example1.txt'
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)


# Read the Example1.txt
file1 = open("Example1.txt", "r")

# Read the file
FileContent = file1.read()
FileContent : 'This is line 1 \nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3'

# Close file after finish
file1.close()

# Verify if the file is closed
file1.closed

# Open file using with
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    FileContent = file1.read()
    print(FileContent)

# Read certain amount of characters
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(7))
    print(file1.read(15))

# Read one line
with open(example1, "r") as file1:

--------Write and Save Files in Python----------
# Write line to file
exmp2 = 'Example2.txt'
with open(exmp2, 'w') as writefile:
    writefile.write("This is line A")
    
# Write lines to file
with open(exmp2, 'w') as writefile:
    writefile.write("This is line A\n")
    writefile.write("This is line B\n")

# Sample list writing to the text file
Lines = ["This is line A\n", "This is line B\n", "This is line C\n"]
with open('Example2.txt', 'w') as writefile:
    for line in Lines:
        print(line)
        writefile.write(line)
        
# Write (Append) a new line to text file
with open('Example2.txt', 'a') as testwritefile:
    testwritefile.write("This is line C\n")
    testwritefile.write("This is line D\n")
    testwritefile.write("This is line E\n")
    
# Copy file to another
with open('Example2.txt','r') as readfile:
    with open('Example3.txt','w') as writefile:
          for line in readfile:
                writefile.write(line)
