# Assign the name in a string veriable
name = "Debasis Kumar Sahu"

# Print the first element in the string
print(name[0])
:D

# Print the last element using negative index
print(name[-1])

# Find the length of string
len("Michael Jackson")

# Take the slice on variable name with only index 0 to index 3
print(name[0:4])
:Deba

# Take the slice on variable name with only index 0 to index 3
print(name[1:5])
:ebas

# Get every second element. The elments on index 1, 3, 5
name[::2]

# Get every second element in the range from index 0 to index 4
name[0:5:2]

# Concatenate two strings
statement = name + "is the best"
